## AlgoTrade Web App

This is a data science for project that predicts Buy-Sell signals based on the price of a stock. 


### Methodology
There are several features I use to determine input features like 5, 20, 50, and 100 days of moving average of the stock price. 
The input features are the cross-section of price with these moving average parameters. I only choose those signals as 1 (cross upwards) and 0 (cross downwards) to predict binary output as Buy and Sell.
The main machine learning algorithm that powers the app is Random Forest Classifier. 


### Warning
I developed this project to educate myself on time-series data and machine learning techniques. 
The results of my model is not a financial advice. Financial investments contains huge risks.
Please do not use AlgoTrade web app in your financial decisions.
